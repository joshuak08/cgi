hold J while rotating to snap
shading->wireframe on shaded
~shift+D, clone place with distance
double click move tool and change world/object relative
edit mesh (top) > add divisions for cloned polygons
shift + RHM > insert edge loop
extrude: shift + move
smooth 123; 3 easy way to check geometry validity
ctrl+h: hide selected, (outliner) shift+h: unhide, alt+h: hide unselected
use shift+R (Extrude) to make a smaller face within another
you can duplicate single faces out of an edge-looped-extruded object
when mirroring don’t cut geometry, mirror axis pos: bounding box/object (pivot point)
can duplicate the ‘mirror point’ face when mirroring, remove that face

not v useful to subdivide faces; use insert edge loop
clicking extrude thru menu introduces new faces instantly even if you don’t move them
booleans are not the best way to edit an object then keep editing said object - gets complicated; no edge loops
