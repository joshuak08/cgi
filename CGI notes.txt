hold J while rotating to snap
shading->wireframe on shaded
~shift+D, clone place with distance
double click move tool and change world/object relative
edit mesh (top) > add divisions for cloned polygons
shift + RHM > insert edge loop
extrude: shift + move
smooth 123; 3 easy way to check geometry validity
ctrl+h: hide selected, (outliner) shift+h: unhide, alt+h: hide unselected
use shift+R (Extrude) to make a smaller face within another
you can duplicate single faces out of an edge-looped-extruded object
when mirroring don’t cut geometry, mirror axis pos: bounding box/object (pivot point)
can duplicate the ‘mirror point’ face when mirroring, remove that face
edit>GROUP
mesh>boolean>union not necessary if object is to be solid (aka not transparent/glass)
edit>delete by type>history
can cut objects in half by using large cube and bool(A-B)
edit mesh>detach & mesh>separate (the shells) and ungroup
create > measure tools > distance tool

not v useful to subdivide faces; use insert edge loop
clicking extrude thru menu introduces new faces instantly even if you don’t move them
booleans are not the best way to edit an object then keep editing said object - gets complicated; no edge loops

W5 - Camera render setups
find out how to create perspective window, to save different perspectives because cannot get exact precise pov again
create different render settings change resolution, windows->rendering editors->render settings->image size->presets
instead of keep re-rendering, in render view can change test resolution, typically pick 25%, find out how

figure out how to save and render multiple frames, can choose start and end frames, remember to pick correct camera from renderable camera

W7
Animation part
Set framerate to 24fps [bottom right walking man logo]
Press bottom bar frame number
Press s to save keyframe
then move scale change object then press another frame and save, maya will do the moving/animating, press s to save keyframe again

To unselect attributes ot not make them red, select all, right click, break connections

Another way not using s, select specific attribute, right click, key selected, make changes, break connections

Graph editor - get it up through windows -> animation editors -> graph editor
inside graph editor can change each attribute for key object each keyframe more precise
tangents changes how the object moves wrt acceleration (curve is polynomial or linear)
Graph editor more precise animations
Test speed of animation create playblast
